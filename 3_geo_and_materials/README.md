# Notes

## Phases of creting elements

1. Geomtery: Creation of the geometry or the "skeleton" of the 3d element we want to add to the scene.

2. Material: Creating of the "skin" or the material the element is made out od. a.k.a texture.

3. Cover the Geometery with the Material. Map the texture onto the 3d object.
